## Plan a Test Suite

Planning a test suite helps ensure you will not need to restructure test cases. By doing so, you reduce execution errors.

Ask yourself the following questions:
* What is your test suite goal?
* How do you want to execute your test suite?

## Define Test Suite goals

A test suite compiles a series of actions depicting a particular user experience on your website.

You plan test cases based on deciding which action a test case should perform. You then create a test suite flow by naming and ordering test cases.

For example, to test userâ€™s online shopping experience, your test suite might include actions as per the following sequence:

* *Sign up* or *log in* test case.
* *Enter shopping cart* test case.
* *Check out* test case.
* *Order confirmation* test case.

Structuring test cases in a test suite prevents chaos and identifies issues before test suite execution.

## Test Suite execution

Once defining test suite goals, the following guidelines could support your test suite execution step by step:
1. [Create a new test suite](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/test-suite.html#create-a-new-test-suite).
2. Plan test suite operation.
    * [Modify execution information](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/test-suite.html#modify-execution-information).
    * [Manage test case list](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/test-suite.html#manage-test-case-list).
3. View [Test suite reports](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/test-suite-report.html#test-suite-report).

    Katalon Studio logs test suite results in different formats and provides a complete account of the test suite process to help spot errors and reduce test case restructuring time.
