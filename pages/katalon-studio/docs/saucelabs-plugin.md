Go to **Project -> Settings**. 

Under **Plugins** section, you will find **Sauce Labs Integration** if the plugin is installed. 

To the right of the panel is a form that allows you to enter your credentials as well as your Sauce Labs desired browser and OS.

*Note:*
* API Key: use an API Key generated from Sauce Labs **User Settings**
* Username: your username displayed in Sauce Labs

Then click “**Generate Sauce Labs Custom Profile**” to finalize your profile. Now you can use the newly created profile to execute your tests.
