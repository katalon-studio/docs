First export your Postman collection to JSON. See the instruction [here](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collections/data_formats/#exporting-and-importing-postman-data). 

Then in Katalon Studio, create a new API/Web Service project (currently the only type of project supporting this Postman collection import feature), and click on Postman icon on the toolbar.
