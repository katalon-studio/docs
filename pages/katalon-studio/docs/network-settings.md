## Bypass SSL server certificate validation

Katalon Studio supports the capability to bypass certificate validation so that users with restricted network policy can work with Katalon Studio as usual. This setting can be found at: **Project > Settings > Network** and it affects WebUI testing.

## SSL client certificates

Katalon Studio can send requests with SSL client certificates. This setting is only applied for requests in API/Web Services projects. The recommended key store format is PKCS #12 (.p12).
