## Schedule your test suite collection within a click

Add a test suite to a test suite collection. In your test suite collection you can configurate the timing of the execution in **Test Suite Scheduling View.**

Click **Schedule**, the pop-up will appear to remind you to not turn off Katalon Studio until the test suite collection is executed.

The **Next run** field will contain the date of the upcoming execution of this test suite collection.Â

If you want to reschedule, you just need to input a new time and hit **Schedule** again. A pop-up will inform you that the old schedule will be overrided.

Now the test suite collection will be executed at the updated time.
