Katalon Store serves as a platform for testers and developers to install add-on products, also known as ‘plugins,’ to help our users add more features and optimize test automation strategies in Katalon Studio. Users can install, manage, rate and write reviews for plugins. These plugins are built to meet users' requests looking to improve their projects' automation efficiency or meet their specific businesses needs.
