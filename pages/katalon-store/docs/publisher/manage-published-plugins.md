Publishing plugins allows them to be used by others, who can access and install them from Katalon Store.

You can publish your plugin publicly so that any Katalon user can find and install it. In addition to published plugins, you can also save your plugin as a draftâ€”this lets you test it or just use it yourself without publishing.

Once you've successfully published a plugin, you can continue to update and manange it in [Published plugins](https://store.katalon.com/manage/publisher) page.
